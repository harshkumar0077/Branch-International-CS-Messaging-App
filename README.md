Run both folders simultaneously to run the Web Application

## Basic Features-

1. A messaging web application that can be used to respond to incoming questions
sent by our customers. The system should allow a team of agents to respond to
incoming messages from (potentially many) customers in a streamlined fashion. The system is designed so that multiple agents can log in at the same time and respond to incoming
messages.

3. The customer messages can be sent and received through an API endpoint which is simulated via a simple web form.

## Additional Features-

1. It helps agents divide work amongst themselves and prevents
multiple agents from working on the same message at once.
2. Implemented search functionality to allow agents to search over incoming messages and /
or customers.
3. Made the agent UI (and/or the customer-facing UI) more interactive by leveraging
WebSockets or similar technology, so that new incoming messages can show up in real
time.
